Feel free to send me emails with suggestion and comments!


Overview
========

Welcome to PyPlugin.
It is a small library to get a simple plugin architecture in your python programs.
It was developed because I think that plugin architecture is a excellent approach for many programs.
I do not like copy and paste code! because of that I created this library instead.
PyPlugin is developed using TDD (test driven development) process and DI (dependency injection)  pattern to get a better and more testeable source code.


Features
========

Configurable.
Extensible.
Event Logging.
Auto discover plugins.
Load and unload plugins.
Dependency handling between plugins.


Documentation
=============

The documentation is in the source, so you should check in the "doc" directory.
Developer *remember* run the tool for create documentation *before* commit changes.


Get involve
==========

If you want to contribute, do not doubt on contact me for information about the soruce code.	
*Please* always keep on mind "Test driven development" and "Dependency injection", to produce a  better and more testeable source code.


Dependencies
============

Python 2.6 or newest
